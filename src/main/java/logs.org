* Server.java:

1. Create a 'Server.java' which has a ServerSocket bound to a particular port and listens for any incoming request

2. When a new request comes, get the Socket for that new request

3. Handle the request by another inner class inside Server.java ie ConnectionHandler.java

NOTE: both Server.java and ConnectionHandler.java are Runnables.



* ConnectionHandler.java

1. implement /constructor/ ConnectionHandler(Socket client) method which just assigns the client to the global variable

2. the actual request is handled by the run() method of the Runnable

3. In the run() first bind the PrintWriter with client socket's OutputStream and BufferedReader with client socket's InputStream(preferably in the try with resources)

4. When the first request comes in, write in the client socket: 'Please enter a nickname: '

5. When the client responds, save the nickname in an instance variable



* Broadcasting the message to all the clients

1. To achieve this, create a List/ArrayList in the Server.java of type 'ConnectionHandler.java'

2. After creating a ConnectionHandler object, call List.add() to add the ConnectionHandler to the List/ArrayList

3. In order to broadcast the message to all of the Connections, just implement the broadcast(Strig message) and go through each ConnectionHandler in the List/ArrayList and call the writeMessage(String message) method for all the Connection Handler

4. broadcast the message when a new Connection is made
